# üéØ Goal Classifier with Confidence Score

A Python-based machine learning system that automatically classifies user goals into 5 predefined business categories and provides confidence scores for each prediction.

## ‚ú® Features

- **5 Business Categories**: Project Management, HR & Onboarding, Finance & Reporting, Marketing & Sales, Operations & Maintenance
- **Confidence Scores**: Each prediction comes with a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Machine Learning**: Uses TF-IDF vectorization with Logistic Regression for accurate classification
- **Batch Processing**: Classify multiple goals at once from text or CSV files
- **Logging**: Automatically saves all predictions to timestamped CSV files
- **Console Output**: Beautiful formatted table display of results

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Classifier

```bash
python goal_classifier.py
```

### 3. View Results

The script will:
- Train the model on built-in training data
- Classify example goals
- Display results in a formatted table
- Save predictions to a CSV file

## üìä How It Works

### Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Text Vectorization**: Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert goal text into numerical features
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracts up to 1000 most important features from the training data
3. **Classification**: Logistic Regression model predicts the category and provides probability scores
4. **Confidence Score**: The highest probability becomes the confidence score

### Training Data

The system comes pre-trained with 95 examples across all 5 categories:
- **Project Management**: 19 examples (e.g., "Plan a product launch", "Create project timeline", "Develop project risk assessment")
- **HR & Onboarding**: 19 examples (e.g., "Hire new employees", "Update employee handbook", "Create diversity and inclusion program")
- **Finance & Reporting**: 19 examples (e.g., "Check revenue for last month", "Prepare quarterly financial report", "Implement financial controls")
- **Marketing & Sales**: 19 examples (e.g., "Launch new marketing campaign", "Analyze customer feedback", "Develop brand positioning strategy")
- **Operations & Maintenance**: 19 examples (e.g., "Update system security", "Maintain server infrastructure", "Establish quality assurance standards")

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goal_classifier.py      # Main classifier script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_goals.txt         # Sample goals for testing

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ goal_predictions_*.csv # Generated prediction logs
```

## üîß Usage Examples

### Single Goal Classification

```python
from goal_classifier import GoalClassifier

# Initialize and train
classifier = GoalClassifier()
classifier.train()

# Classify a single goal
goal = "Plan a product launch"
category, confidence = classifier.classify_goal(goal)
print(f"Category: {category}")
print(f"Confidence: {confidence:.3f}")
```

### Batch Classification

```python
# Classify multiple goals
goals = [
    "Plan a product launch",
    "Update company onboarding guide",
    "Check revenue for last month"
]

predictions = classifier.classify_multiple_goals(goals)
for goal, category, confidence in predictions:
    print(f"{goal} ‚Üí {category} (Confidence: {confidence:.3f})")
```

### Load Goals from File

```python
from goal_classifier import load_test_data_from_file

# Load from text file (one goal per line)
goals = load_test_data_from_file("my_goals.txt")

# Load from CSV file (first column should contain goals)
goals = load_test_data_from_file("my_goals.csv")
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plan a product launch                    Project Management   0.923
Update company onboarding guide          HR & Onboarding      0.891
Check revenue for last month             Finance & Reporting  0.945
Launch new marketing campaign            Marketing & Sales    0.878
Update system security                   Operations & Maint.  0.912
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total goals classified: 5
```

### CSV Log File

The system automatically saves predictions to CSV files with columns:
- `timestamp`: ISO format timestamp
- `goal`: The input goal text
- `category`: Predicted category
- `confidence`: Confidence score (0.000 to 1.000)

Example CSV output:
```csv
timestamp,goal,category,confidence
2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456,Plan a product launch,Project Management,0.923
2024-01-15T10:30:45.124567,Update company onboarding guide,HR & Onboarding,0.891
```

- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (< 50MB)

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Categories

To add new categories, modify the `categories` list and `_create_training_data()` method in the `GoalClassifier` class:

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.categories = [
        "Project Management",
        "HR & Onboarding", 
        "Finance & Reporting",
        "Marketing & Sales",
        "Operations & Maintenance",
        "New Category"  # Add your category here
    ]
```

### Modifying Training Data

Add more examples to improve classification accuracy:

```python
def _create_training_data(self):
    training_data = [
        # ... existing examples ...
        ("Your new goal example", "Your Category"),
        # ... more examples ...
    ]
    return training_data
```

## üìù Requirements

- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Dependencies**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Memory**: Minimum 50MB RAM
- **Storage**: < 10MB for the script and dependencies

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Error**: Make sure all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Low Confidence**: The model may need more training examples for specific categories
3. **File Not Found**: Ensure test files are in the same directory as the script

### Performance Tips

- Use clear, descriptive goal text for better classification
- Avoid very short or ambiguous goals
- The model works best with business-related goals
